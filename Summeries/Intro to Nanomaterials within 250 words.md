Nanomaterials are materials whose internal or external dimensions range from 1 nm to 100 nm. (ISO/IEC,2010) In contrast, a conventional material, commonly known as “macro-material” under such comparison, does not require nano-scale fabrication and can usually be observed with bare eyes. (Banerjee, 2012) Thanks to their unique structural characteristics, nanomaterials exhibit novel properties that are useful for industrial and biological purposes. These features, mostly originated from quantum effects, reveal only at small scale and are absent in traditional materials. An eminent example is the “tunnelling effect”, which engineers exploit to assemble tiny transistors in integrated circuits. (Chowdhury, 2015) Billions of such transistors can be arranged onto chips smaller than a finger nail, generally referred to as Central Processing Units. They are the brains to virtually all smart devices available today, from mobile phones to supercomputers and spaceships. As of medical use, an instance would be nanoparticles that assist drug delivery. Because of their high biocompatibility, which means they work well within living systems, nanomaterials are considered potential carriers of cell-specific medicines. (Saxena, 2013) Even better, they also appear to be selectively toxic in cancer treatments, which is a critical character because one wants to differentiate normal cells from malicious ones. This booming market of electronics, as well as the promising future of clinical applications, is a strong proof that nanomaterial and nanotechnology are becoming ubiquitous in our daily life.
