# Infrared Spectrometry in water vapor

## 1 Introduction

To reduce patient’s pain and to get better control over an operation, a physician always applies narcosis before surgery, so that the patient will not feel too much pain and usually just falls asleep during the process. However, a person under anesthesia is not able to tell, or tell others, whether he or she is feeling well or not. In scenerios where there is a possibility for the operation to cause death, it is especially critical for physicians to apply a non-intrusive approach to monitor vital information.

Capnography monitors the CO2 concentration in inhale and exhale gases of the patient, is a time-tested method used to detect life-threatening conditions.[^3] It is also widely adapted in postoperative period, along with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and by intensive care units (ICUs).[^1]

## 2 Infrared Spectrometry

Heteronuclear molecules such as carbon dioxide (CO2) have characteristic man- ner for absorbing infra-red (IR) light, thus IR spectrometry is applicable in quantitatively measuring these gases.[^1]

Compared to other methods, IR spectrometry shows better selectivity, can be made in a more compact design, let alone that it costs less both in appratus manufactory and application. These advantages all made IR sensing the most popular detection technique for carbon dioxide.[^2]

### 2.1 Sensing Mechanism

The infrared spectrometry is mostly about spectrum absorption. It all starts with an infrared beam impinging the sample gas. In the sample container, CO2 and other molecules are, hopefully, "elevated" to an excited state by absorbing a photon with specific energy.

This specificity can be exploited to retreive information about the compo- sition of the sample. By substracting the transimission curve from a reference spectrum (one that stay untouched by the sample), the absorption data can be deduced. Further comparison with literature records would yield the concentra- tion of CO2 in this particular sample.[^4]

### 2.2 Basic Layout of the Instrument

The gaseous sample is collected into a sample cell. The cell have to be suffiicently long in dimension in order to compensate for the diluteness due to being in gaseous phase, in contrast to liquid and solid samples.[^4]

A light source is required to radiate IR light onto the sample. Usually this can be done by a traditional light source that provides a continuous spectrum over a broad range in the infrared region, whose wavelength is about 780 nm up to 1000 nm. Meanwhile, lasers can provide emission spectrum that precisely matches the absorption peaks of carbon dioxide. FYI, this molecule-targeting approach, called Molecular Correlation Spectrography (MCS), can applied to measurements of samples other than CO2 as well.[^2]

CO2, along with other asymmetric molecules in the sample, absorbs the incoming spectrum according to unique patterns. In other words, they differ in the amount of light they absorb at every wavelength, which is directly linked to the energy level differences between different states. These characteristic information can be exploited to deduce the composition of the gaseous sample.[^4]

To perceive the information, the transmitted light shall be collected by an sensor. Some receiver simply amplifies the incoming light and spread the transmission spectrum onto a screen, while some converts the optical information to electrical signals, which can be then processed electronically using a computer, etc. For the case of CO2, which has a characteristic absorption peak around 4400 nm, photoconductive detectors made with PbSe or InSb, photovoltaic detectors made with PtSi and InSb-based photodiode detectors can be used.[^5]

This can be achieved by scanning the wavelength range using a monochromator. Alternatively, the whole wavelength range is mea- sured at once using a Fourier transform instrument and then a trans- mittance or absorbance spectrum is generated using a dedicated procedure.[^6]

### 2.3 Detection Sensitivity

IR spectrometry is indeed convenient, but that does not suggest that it is perfect. There are still many factors that may contribute to an measuring error during operation. These aspects mainly fall into two categories: one type of them can be found in every application of infrared spectrometry, and the other kind only appears in the practice of capnography.

For example, “hot bands” is an effect that could be seen in most IR spectrometry- related situations. It happens when the sample has a high temperature, and would cause a peak shift in the absorption curve. This can be explained using the Boltzmann distribution, where high temperature is related to high average energy, which suggests that the electrons have a tendency to populate higher excited states, and in turn will lead to the absorption peak shifting to a lower energy, since it requires less energy to excite an electron onto the targeted ex- cited state if it is already excited a little bit beforehand.[^8] This is shown with a neat example in Statistical Mechanics (PHYS359, a course we took this term in BJTU).

Factors common only in capnography includes the influence of atmospheric pressure and response time of the device. Components other than CO2 also contribute to the result as noise signals. These compounds include nitrous oxide (NO), oxygen (O2), water vapor (H2O) and inhalational agents.[^9]

## 3 Conclusion

Above I have shown that capnography is helpful in monitoring ventilation and can be used as an early warning system in hospitals, and that infrered spec- trometry played central role in its performance. In other words, capnography is mostly an application of infrared spectrometry targeted towards the CO2. Nevertheless, disadvantages lie hidden in the multiplicity of factors that could contribute to an error during measurement. All in all, this is a great tool for physicians and life-saver for thousands of patients. Thanks for its wide spread- ing, safety in health care is greatly ensured.
