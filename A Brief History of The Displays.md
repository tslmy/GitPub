A Brief History of The Displays
========
Humans tend to express themselves in vivid, dazzling ways: they replaced symphony with jazz, substituted gowns with mini-skirts, and the same fate happened to paper in the last one hundred years, whose successors are called “displays”. 

The story starts with a electronic gun called cathode ray tube (CRT). 117 years ago, a German scientist named Karl Ferdinand Braun placed a fluorescent screen in front of such a tube applied with periodically scanning voltage, making the first cathode-ray oscilloscope in the world, which later turned out to be the forefather of all modern general-purpose monitors. (Anderson, 2001) This invention inspired talented ones with the unlimited possibility that you can demonstrate on a 5-inch piece of glass. Television is a representative masterpiece of this era. Since the ray tube requires a certain distance away from the fluorescent surface, CRT monitors are more like a box rather than a panel, making it too bulky for mobile purposes. (Anderson, 2001) Even desktop users dreamed about a thinner device to save desktop space for potted plants and tea cups.

That demand eventually facilitated the invention of liquid crystal displays (LCD). The greatest inventor does not have to be a marketing genius; LCD was invented in RCA Laboratories by Dr. George H. Heilmeier in the 1960s (Lowe, 1997), and was commercialized by the Sharp Corporation in Japan in late 1990. (Sanger, 1990) Besides saving space, LCD monitors was also proven to be more energy-efficient compared to traditional CRT displays (Rice, 2011), which require high voltages to drive up ray tubes (Anderson, 2001). As John Sweeney, vice president of sales and marketing for ICS puts it, “We see LCDs displacing CRTs entirely.” (O’Brien, 2005)



The history did not stop there: a revolution of backlighting went on behind the screens. Traditionally, LCD panels make use of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) for backlighting. This was gradually replaced by light-emitting diode (LED) backlights in the 2000s. This transition was strongly advocated by the European Union, whose RoHS initiative suggested curbing the usage of heavy metals such as mercury, which was essential in CCFL manufacturing back then. Besides pollution concerns, LED light works better matching the RGB filter in the liquid crystal display, providing more accurately saturated images than CCFL models. What’s more, LED panel also offers extended device durability since it generates almost no heat during operation. Less energy dissipation also enables LED to output comparable brightness to CCFL but under a much lower voltage. Plus, it is also more efficient in utilizing the light generated:

"A CCFL may produce more lumens/watt than an LED," said DeAgazio, " but it's a diffuse light source,so you get a lot of wasted light." LEDs, in contrast, are highly directional and thus "easy to couple efficiently into a light guide.” (Lieberman, 2007)

These features made LED a better choice for mobile LCDs, where battery life is the primary limitation. (Lieberman, 2007) In fact, it has also won dominance in the general-purpose market, leaving CCFL monitor to voltage-limited applications with higher brightness requirement. (Lim, 2013)

The LED has long been misunderstood as only capable of rough jobs such as backlighting LCD panels, decorating signboards and broadcasting advertisements on the Times Square. This misconception is proven wrong with the new-born display technology - OLED. In comparison to liquid crystal displays, OLED offers wider viewing angle, higher brightness, truer color, lighter weight, thinner design and less energy consumption. However, the temperamental chemistry involved in its production is keeping the cost high above the averagely affordable level of desktop users. (Zaccaria, 2008) On the other hand, in mobile applications such as smartphones, where screens are usually less pricy due to relatively smaller sizes, this has little impact. Statistically speaking, the OLED shipment for cellphones is expected to rise eightfold from 2009 to 2015, according to M2 Presswire. (M2 Presswire, 2009) Plus, with an organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) backplane, OLED screens can be made bendable like a piece of paper, while LCD possesses no flexibility at all. (Steudel, 2012) As a matter of fact, curved OLED TV has been put into mass production by the conglomerate from South Korea, Samsung (Manama, 2013), which is also the largest OLED panel manufacturer in the world (Business Wire, 2009). To sum it up, OLED will replace LCD, just like what the latter has done to the CRT monitor. In addition, several cooperations predicted that OLED panels would rule the monitor market before 2012. (Bulkeley, 2007)

As human's appetite for thinness, vividness and flexibility of the screen goes expanding, and with touchable interfaces, including smartphones and tablets, getting popular around the globe, a brand-new generation of display technology is surely on its way. The evolution of displays, just like any other technology, will continue to go on.
