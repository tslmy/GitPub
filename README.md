GitPub
=======
Transform a GitHub git into a blog/doc site. No static-site generator required.

To your readers, it's a view-only GitHub frontend designed only for reading.

To yourself, it's a verstile platform.

Feature
-------
Deadly simple publishing via git pushes.

### Hosted on your GitHub

Not exactly cloud-hosting or self-hosting.

* Like cloud-hosting, you don't need to install anything on your machine or keep it up 24/7.
* Like self-hosting, you get total control over your files (it's a GitHub repo, after all).

### Upload posts as files via git; no admin page provided

Different from WordPress, HuePress, Medium and Ghost, GitPub does not offer you a webpage where you get to type and save your content. Instead, GitPub encourages you to write in your favorite text editor and then push it to the repo. 

Not to worry if you don't have your text editor at hand in your local library; simply log onto GitHub and create a new file in this repo.

### Posts stored as piles of Markdown files

In case you haven't heard of it, Markdown is a simple markup language that provides rich content within plain text files.

By saving your posts as individual posts, you can easily migrate your posts to anywhere you want and read them with a text editor. 

#### No database or weird data strcture

Do you hate it when you try to export all your entries from Evernote, OneNote, WordPress, Ghost, etc. only to found out that they all have their own packaging formats?

I mean, half of the time when you try to export from a platform, you intend to switch to another product, right? It is really a pain to discover that you cannot easily import the oddly-shaped backup file to your new platform due to file format problems.

I wish to solve this problem by keeping all files as purely-structured as possible. That means, every post is saved in an individual markdown file, so that you can do whatever you want with them.
