What energy sources can be installed on a per-household basis and help cut down power bills? Solar power and biomass power seem to be the most promising answers. Bluffing though these terms may sound, their applications can come in unsophisticated forms. Householders can assemble solar power collectors and biomass generators without too much hassle (McKendry, 2012). In fact, these appliances are already popular in rural areas where energy is expensive (Cecelski, 2015). While solar panels and biomass converters are easy to establish, they differ in aspects such as heights they reside in homes and purposes they serve for families. 
First, while solar panels are often placed high above the roof, biomass gasifiers are usually installed down below the ground (Wiginton, 2010). Since it is sunshine that provides solar energy, panels must stay unhindered from shadows. Thus, the ideal locations are rooftops, where solar panels are most exposed to sunlight. Meanwhile, biomass gasification requires the use of anaerobic bacteria (Chynoweth, 2001). These microorganisms can only digest organic wastes in oxygen-free environment. To prevent gas leakage, bioreaction containers are often buried underground. The fact that biomass and solar energy are collected at different altitudes ensures their spatial compatibility. This in turn contributes to their popularity in compact residential areas.
Aside from difference in elevation, biomass and solar power also serve for distinct purposes. Usually, sunshine is converted to electricity, whereas biomass is meant for burning (Cheng, 2012). While solar power can be kept in cells, biomass can be stored in fuels (Ludwig, 2003). As cell works by conducting, fuel acts via combusting. Moreover, although solar power covers a broader spectrum of application then biomass does, specializations between solar power and biomass cannot swap (Green, 1982). Sunshine indeed carries heat, yet biomass cannot generate electricity. One can use electrical power to cook on a stovetop, but one cannot use thermal energy to work on a laptop. In summary, solar power and biomass energy generally cannot serve as interchangeable sources.
In conclusion, discrepancies such as locations and applications exist between solar power and biomass. Such differences ensure that these energy sources can operate compatibly yet independently. This mutual independence implies that solar power and biomass energy can serve as backups to each other in case one fails. Together, solar panel and biomass converter can serve as a single power source more reliable than either of them working on its own. This combined secondary generator can help with reducing power bills for average households (Wu, 2006). Further research may reveal new technology that enhances efficiency of domestic power source. In the future, self-served generators may replace electric grids as the primary power source for households.
